<h1>Sequence Alignment</h1>
<h2>Part 0: Files</h2>
<p>We are going to use proteomes of some classic genomes: C. elegans, D.
melanogaster, and A. thaliana. If you want to use your own favorite
genome, go ahead.</p>
<h2>Part 1: Local Alignment</h2>
<p>The first program we are going to use for alignment is called <code>water</code>,
which is named after the <strong>Smith-Waterman</strong> algorithm. This comes from
the <strong>EMBOSS</strong> suite of bioinformatics programs, which is installed on
your system. One of the first things you should do when using a new
program is to skim the documentation. Some bioinformatics programs will
have <code>man</code> pages, but not all. <code>water</code> doesn't come with a <code>man</code> page,
but there is good documentation online at the EMBOSS site. Most
bioinformatics programs will have a <strong>usage statement</strong> that gives you
some help with the program. To display the usage statement, try the
<code>-h</code>, <code>-help</code>, <code>--help</code> options or try using the program without any
arguments. The <code>water</code> program responds to the first three, but if you
give it no arguments, it will start prompting you for arguments (which
can be useful or annoying depending on your mindset).</p>
<p>As you gain more experience with bioinformatics tools, you will find a
large variety of command line syntaxes and usage statements. Why?
Because most scientific programmers aren't professional software
developers. They don't always follow the rules and best practices of the
Unix community.</p>
<pre><code>water -h
</code></pre>
<p>There are not may options. We need to provide two sequence files,
penalties for gap opening and extension, and an output file. The scoring
matrix appears to BLOSUM62 by default but others are available (see
<code>/usr/share/EMBOSS/data</code> or <code>/usr/local/share/EMBOSS/data</code>). Let's try
the interactive mode.</p>
<pre><code>water
</code></pre>
<p>The program now asks for the name of the input sequence file. You can't
tab-complete this. That's enough reason for me to NEVER USE THE
INTERACTIVE MODE, but if you like it, go ahead.</p>
<p>So where are we going to get our sequence files from? Let's grab the
first protein from the A. thaliana, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster
proteomes to begin. You can use <code>head</code> with a command line option for
the number of lines and the <code>&gt;</code> redirection symbol for this task. Save
these files as <code>at1.fa</code>, <code>ce1.fa</code>, and <code>dm1.fa</code>. You might want to write
a bit in your <code>lab1_notebook.md</code> file about how you did this. You can
even paste in parts of your <code>history</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's try aligning the various files to each other.</p>
<pre><code>water at1.fa ce1.fa -gapopen 10 -gapextend 5 -outfile at_ce.water
</code></pre>
<p>Read the output of this command with <code>less</code>. Note the score, percent
identity, percent similarity, and score. Is a score of 37 (or whatever)
good? Hmm, that's a difficult question. What exactly does "good" mean?
Should a good score mean that two sequences are evolutionarily related?
That they have similar function? As a scientist, one of the first
questions you should ask yourself is how likely that alignment could
have occurred at random.</p>
<h2>Part 2: Random Expectation</h2>
<p>In order to determine what the random background of sequence alignment
looks like, we need to make some random sequences. There are several
ways to go about doing this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a program that uses 5% probability for each amino acid</li>
<li>Write a program that uses <em>realisitc</em> probabilities</li>
<li>Write a program that randomizes real sequences</li>
<li>Use EMBOSS <code>shuffleseq</code> or some other program</li>
</ul>
<p>Make some random sequences and then align them a bunch of times with
<code>water</code>. This will give you an idea of what alignment score is expected
at random. If you really want to explore what random looks like, you'll
have to perform this experiment thousands of times. So script the whole
thing from sequence generation to histogram.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate random sequences</li>
<li>Align sequences</li>
<li>Get maximum score</li>
<li>Create a table of maximum scores</li>
</ul>
<p>After performing some experiments, answer these questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the shape of the curve normal? </li>
<li>Do you expect it to be normal?</li>
<li>Do you expect all protein comparisons to have the same distribution?</li>
<li>What factors might change the distribution and how?</li>
<li>How might real sequences be different from random?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 3: Karlin-Altschul Stats</h2>
<p>Karlin-Altschul statistics tells us that the expected number of
alignments that exceed some score depends on the score, lambda, the size
of the sequences, and a few other parameters (see lecture notes). K-A
also forbids gaps and has some other restrictions. But is that all
really true? The way to find out is with some experimentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a program to examine the effect of sequence lengths</li>
<li>Write a program to examine compositional effects</li>
<li>Write a program to examine gap penalties</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 4: Alignment Significance</h2>
<p>Your task is to determine the statistical significance of an alignment.
The query sequence is B0213.10, which can be found in the C. elegans
proteome. Search this against all A. thaliana and D. melanogaster
proteins to find its homologs.</p>
<p>Before you begin, it's a good idea to get an idea how long it will take
to do the experiment. Will your experiment take seconds, minutes, hours,
days, or longer? Before attempting to do the whole experiment, it pays
to do a small fraction first. Don't begin until you can answer the
following questions?</p>
<ul>
<li>How many amino acids can I align per second?</li>
<li>How many amino acids do I need to align to do this experiment?</li>
<li>How long would it take to compare two proteomes?</li>
</ul>
<p>Set up the experiment any way you like. You will need to use the unix
<code>time</code> command. You need to be able to answer the following questions.
Note that some questions are very open-ended and may be very difficult
to answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the best match in each genome?</li>
<li>What protein is this?</li>
<li>What are the alignment properties (% identity, etc)</li>
<li>What is the expected score of your alignment at random?</li>
<li>How different is your best score from random?</li>
<li>How statistically significant is this score?</li>
<li>How biologically significant is this score?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 5: BLASTP</h2>
<p>BLASTP is supposed to be a lot like Smith-Waterman, but better. Peform
the same experiment above, but with BLASTP. To get a usage statement for
<code>blastp</code>, type its name on the command line.</p>
<pre><code>blastp
</code></pre>
<p>There is a bewildering number of options! And you'll have to format a
database with <code>xdformat</code> before you can use <code>blastp</code>. Here's how you
format a protein database of the C. elegans proteome (assuming its name
is <code>worm</code>).</p>
<pre><code>xdformat -p worm
</code></pre>
<p>This creates several new files with various extensions. These extra
files are the BLAST database. To search it with some other fasta file,
the command line is very simple.</p>
<pre><code>blastp worm other_file.fa
</code></pre>
<p>There are many ways to control <code>blastp</code>. But before we do that, let's
redo the experiment in Part 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast is <code>blastp</code> compared to <code>water</code>?</li>
<li>Do you believe the statistics in the BLAST report?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 6: Orthologs</h2>
<p>We previously aligned B0213.10 to the A. thalian and D. melanogaster
genomes. The best match is often the <em>ortholog</em> but really, the best
reciprocal match is a better definition of the ortholog. That is, after
finding the best match to the fly genome, one must take the fly protein
and search it against the worm proteome to determine if it finds
B0213.10. If if it does, the proteins are orthologous.</p>
<p>Let's do something ambitious. Let's find ALL the orthologous proteins
between worm and fly (or any two genomes). First thing, we had better
estimate how long that will take. You can do that by aligning a few
sequences and timing it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of parameters that contol the speed of BLAST. The most
important of these are the seeding parameters. The default <code>blastp</code>
search uses <code>W=3 T=11</code>. We can change the seeding parameters quite a
bit. We will set <code>T=999</code> so that there is no <strong>neighborhood</strong> aound each
word match. In other words, only exact matches will produce a seed.
Let's vary the word match from 1 to 6.</p>
<pre><code>time blastp worm whatever T=999 W=1 &gt; w1.blast
time blastp worm whatever T=999 W=2 &gt; w2.blast
etc.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>How much faster does <code>blastp</code> run at higher word sizes?</li>
<li>High speed reduces sensitivity. What is acceptable?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Time to set up the searches. Create BLAST databases for each proteome
and then search one against the other. Do these in separate terminals so
they run at the same time (or you can background them).</p>
<pre><code>blastp worm fly mformat=2 hspmax=1 E=1e-15 W=5 warnings &gt; wvf.blastp
blastp fly worm mformat=2 hspmax=1 E=1e-15 W=5 warnings &gt; fvw.blastp
</code></pre>
<p>A few command line switches were added. <code>mformat=2</code> made the output
tabular. <code>hspmax=1</code> made it so that only the best alignment was shown
(there can be more than one unlike <code>water</code>). <code>warnings</code> turns off some
warning messages.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once the jobs are complete use <code>less</code> to examine the outputs of each
(actually, you can do this even before the jobs are complete). Columns
1, 2, and 3 contain the names of the proteins and the E-value of the
match. If it makes it easier, you can <code>cut</code> these, but you might want to
look at other columns of the file.</p>
<pre><code>cut -f 1-3 wvf
</code></pre>
<p>Use the <code>less</code> search feature (forward slash key) to find proteins in
one file that match proteins in the other file. Find some putative
orthologs. Answer the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What difficulties are there in finding orthologs?</li>
<li>Which BLAST parameters might you change if you did this again?</li>
<li>What additional information would you like to have?</li>
<li>What logic would you use to find orthologs automatically?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 7: Paralogs</h2>
<p>In this part, we are going to look for the <strong>paralogs</strong> of a couple worm
genes: T21B10.2a and B0213.10. That is, we are going to search the these
proteins against the C. elegans proteome to look for sequences that
arose by duplication within the same genome. A gene may have from 0 to
many paralogs. A simple, but flawed way to determine which alignments
represent paralogs is to use an E-value cutoff. But it's a good place to
start.</p>
<pre><code>blastp worm T21B10.2a &gt; T21B10.2a.blastp
blastp worm B0213.10 &gt; B0213.10.blastp
</code></pre>
<p>Inspect the BLAST report with <code>less</code>. Do all the sequences look like
they are highly related? You may want to change the E-value cutoff to
something higher or lower than 1e-10.</p>
<ul>
<li>What parameters did you choose for the search?</li>
<li>How did you choose the parameters? What trade-offs were considered?</li>
<li>What other properties would be useful for finding paralogs?</li>
<li>How would you identify paralogs using BLAST?</li>
</ul>
