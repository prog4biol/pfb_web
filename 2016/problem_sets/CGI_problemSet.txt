CGI Exercises

Problem #1

Write a CGI script that prompts the user for his or her name and age. When the
user presses the submit button, convert the age into "dog years" (divide by 7) and
print the result.

It is useful to include the following to print your errors and warnings to the browser:

  use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser warningsToBrowser);



Problem #2

Extra credit: Translate the codons into protein.
