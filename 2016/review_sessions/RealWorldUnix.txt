Additional Unix Tools: A Demo
============================================================
Earlier, we saw that Bash has some useful commands for checking and
manipulating files quickly; for example, the idiom:
$ column -t cuffdiff.txt | less -S



Occasionally you'll recieve a data file from a Windows user (or maybe you
exported some data from Excel yourself); Windows and MS Office products
(even the ones for Mac) do not use newline characters to terminate a line,
they use the more archaic carriage return ("\r") character. When you `less'
the file, you may see a bunch of ^M codes in the file and all the data will
appear on a single line. We can examine every character in the file (even
the non-printing ones) directly with the following command:
$ od -c windowsfile.txt



We can convert these files to a more Unix-friendly format with the `tr' tool
(the `tr' tool only reads input from stdin, so we have to pipe the file into
it with `cat'):
$ cat windowsfile.txt | tr '\r' '\n' >unixfile.txt

Unix: Real World Problems
============================================================

1. Split /pfbhome/data/secret_seqs.fastq into five files with the `split' tool.


2. Use Unix to wrap the fasta sequences in /pfbhome/data/Perl_III.fasta


3. Some tools, such as samtools, throw errors when blank lines are observed in
fasta and fastq files, use `tr' to remove these blank lines from the sequence
file: /pfbhome/data/Perl_IV.fasta


4. Use Unix tools to determine how many reference sequences (chromosomes) are
represented in the /pfbhome/data/cuffdiff.txt file; output these reference
names into a new file.


5. Use Unix to calculate the total nucleotide composition of the sequences in 
/pfbhome/data/Trinity.fasta


6. Use `tar' to compress a directory of files (e.g., run
`tar -czvf 16S.tar.gz /pfbhome/data/Metagenomic/16S'). Read the man page for
`tar' and learn how to list the contents of the tar file. From this tar file,
extract out a single file.
